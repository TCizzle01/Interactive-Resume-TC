# Project-interactiveResume-Capstone
Final Project

This is the final project for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development Class. This site is a template for an interactive resume'. 
Clicking on each button reveals a different element of a resume. 
When the the viewer becomes skinny the tabs allign verticaly for easier viewing.  
When the view changes to landscape and the screen is still small the tabs move over to the right so the name may still be displayed. The photo at the bottom is also hidden to clean up the viewport. 

CSS feaatures: A nth child on the skills section highlights every other list item for easier reading. The job and school options are in a grid format. 

Known bugs: when the viewport is in landscape mode and under 800px wide the photos dissapear and the buttons are not alligned. git
